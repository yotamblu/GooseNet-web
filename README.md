# GooseNet Web

The web frontend for **GooseNet**, a running-focused platform that connects athletes and coaches through structured workouts, Garmin integration, and performance-driven analytics.

This repository contains the **Next.js (App Router)** web experience for GooseNet, including the public landing page, animated product demos, and future coach/athlete dashboards.

## 🏃 What is GooseNet?

GooseNet is built specifically for **running training**.

It helps coaches plan and assign structured workouts, allows athletes to execute them on their Garmin devices, and provides both sides with clean, actionable performance data after each session.

GooseNet is **not** a generic fitness app and **not** a social network. It is a focused training platform built around real coaching workflows.
